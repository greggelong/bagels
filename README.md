## a JavaScript version of bagels logic guessing game

Using p5js DOM library to select and handle elements. 

Here is an retro text based logic game, much like many games I played or coded in BASIC on the Commodore 64.

Jim Butterfield had many articles at the time with going through the logic of these in basic and machine

language.

The logic of this game is very close to the python code that Al Sweigart has in his great book

https://inventwithpython.com/chapter11.html

But as JavaScript and python handle arrays and lists so differently, almost none of the code stays the same.

Each of the JavaScrit functions have a similar 'function' to the Python code, but they are implemented in different ways.

Even the logic of the REPL of python must be handled by the DOM in JavaScript so the game loop is completely different
