# bagles
## a javascript version of bagles logic guessing game

The logic of this game is very close to the python code that Al Sweigart has in his great book

https://inventwithpython.com/chapter11.html

But as javascript and python handle arrays and lists so differntly, almost none of the code stays the same.

And athough the functions have a simular 'function' they are implemented in differnt ways.

Even the logic of the REPL of python must be handled by the DOM in Javascript so the game loop is completly different
